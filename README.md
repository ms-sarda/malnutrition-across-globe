# Malnutrition Across the Globe
A Tableau dashboard showing malnutrition statistics across the world.

## Motivation

Nearly half of all deaths in children under 5 are attributable to undernutrition. Undernutrition puts children at greater risk of dying from common infections and increases the frequency and severity of such infections. It delays the recovery and affects the growth of affected children. We believe malnutrition is a major cause of concern and therefore we would like to study it and the effect it has globally.

## Dataset

The dataset that we have worked with is the [UNICEF Child Malnutrition dataset](https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/malnutrition/ "UNICEF Malnutrition Dataset"). This is a public dataset provided by the UNICEF website. 

The data spans all the countries and provides data for 21 years - from 2000 to 2020. It is important to note that these numbers do not account for the impact of COVID-19. For each country, it includes the numbers for overweight, stunting, wasting and underweight children. In each of these categories, there are three estimates of the numbers - point estimate, lower uncertainty bound and upper uncertainty bound.
